## 📖 About
**Cookie TMS** is an open-source, self-hosted Transportation Management System designed for logistics companies who are tired of expensive, complicated software.

We combine **Real-time GPS Tracking** (powered by Traccar) with **Business Intelligence** (Invoicing, Route Optimization, and Driver Performance).

**Why "Cookie"?** Because like a browser cookie, this system remembers everything—every route, every stop, and every liter of fuel.
